Me
--
I am performing the duties of Quality Engineer in the cross-functional US Engineering Team and I participating in IoT projects. I perform End to End, UI and API automatic tests and create test documentation.

I use *Python* and *TypeScript* to create automated tests, as well as [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) tools. For documentation and work management [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) and [TestRail](https://www.testrail.com/).

IoT projects I'm involved in my work:
- **[Skyler Elevate](https://relayr.io/skyler-elevate/)** - IoT project for monitoring and analyzing the operation of passenger and freight elevators
- **DuraSense** - IoT project for monitoring the operation of logistics hubs

Web site projects in which I tested the Front End:
- [BLIK](https://blik.com/en)
- [ERBUD](https://www.erbud.pl/en)
- [Moraj](https://company.moraj.pl/en)
- [Famak](https://www.famak.pl/en)


Some of my simple solutions - sometimes useful :P

- **[API_test_engine](https://github.com/Pjotair/portfolio/tree/main/API_test_engine)** Test engine to validate the defined status code and response template
- **[Postman_result_TestRail](https://github.com/Pjotair/portfolio/tree/main/Postman_result_TestRail)** Code to automatically report the results of tests performed in Postman to TestRail
- **[python_exercises](https://github.com/Pjotair/portfolio/tree/main/python_exercises)** -> Here I post solutions to various problems using Python
